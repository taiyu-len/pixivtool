PixivTool
=========
A poorly put together pixiv downloader written in C using libcurl.

Doesnt do all that much at the moment. Ill try to add more to it later when

i feel like it. it was pretty fun putting it together though.

usage
-----
`./pixivtool A B C   # where A B C are illustration IDs (also temporary name)`

You will then need to input your pixiv username & password,
and then it will download the illustrations to the folder it was run in.

Not very much in the way of error checking so far though.
Doesnt work on animated images either.
